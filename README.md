# INF1301 - Modular Programming

Projects for the Modular Programming course at PUC-Rio.


## Project 1

The first project's objective is to get the student familiarized with Arndt Von Staa's C testing framework (aka "Arcabou√ßo de Testes"). 


## Project 2

We implemented a directed graph using an arcane structure composed of linked lists, and tested it.


## Project 3

We implemented a checkmate checker. It asked the user to input the position of each chess piece on the board. Custom chess pieces were supported, as well as saving and loading finished simulations.

The chess board was implemented as a matrix, which was implemented using the graph developed in Project 2, which was implemented using linked lists. Yeah, **I know**.


## Project 4

We used Arndt's framework to help us test the developed graph for correctness.


## PS

This course was **hell**.
